# Predicting Magnitude of Forest Fires

A study of how environmental and weather factors can help predict area burned in a forest fire. 

Created as the final project of [STAT 301: Statistical Modelling for Data Science](https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=STAT&course=301). To view this project's proposal, navigate to `stat_301_project/Proposal.ipynb`. To view the final report, go to `stat_301_project/Final_Report.ipynb`. 



## Technologies
The analysis and report was made in Jupyter notebooks, using R with packages such as Tidyverse and Metrics.

## Setup
Clone this repository. 

If needed, install Jupyter and R on your local machine, and set up the Jupyter kernel to run R code. 

Open up the final report (`stat_301_project/Final_Report.ipynb`), install the necessary packages, then run all the cells. Enjoy!
