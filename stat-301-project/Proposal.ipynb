    "In this analysis, we are drawing from a data set that is trustworthy. For one, there are no missing values. This means we donâ€™t have to omit any observations, or fill in blanks ourselves, which makes our report more reliable. Additionally, the nature of the data is objective. By taking measurements of location, weather aspects, and area burnt, there is very little human subjectivity involved. Finally, by setting the seed to maintain consistent results and explaining our decision-making along the way, we will produce a reproducible and trustworthy report from the data."

    "Our report could be useful in many ways. For one, our results could help with resource designation, as there are only a finite amount of resources for fire-fighting. Therefore, if we know, for example, that low humidity is a big indicator of forest fire area, we can allocate more fire-fighting resources to areas with low-humidity than to high-humidity areas. In addition, our results could help with fire-preparation. If the data indicates that a fire is predicted to cover a very large area, it could be life saving to alert citizens of the danger to evacuate with ample warning."
