    "In this analysis, we are drawing from a data set that is trustworthy. For one, there are ___ missing values. In addition, the nature of the data is objective. By taking measurements of location, weather aspects, and area burnt, there is very little human subjectivity involved. Finally, by setting the seed and explaining our decision-making along the way, we produce a reproducible and trustworthy report."

    "Our report could be useful in many ways. For one, our results could help with resource designation. We only have finite resources for fire-fighting. Therfore, if we know that low humidity is a big indicator of forset fire area, we can set up low-humidity areas with more fire-fighting resources than high-humidity areas. In addition, our results could help with fire-preperation. If data indicates that if a fire were to occur, it would cover a very large area, it could be prudent to alert citizens of this fire danger."
