    "Over the past few years, extreme forest fires have raised a global concern for it being a major environmental problem. The conditions on Earth are now more conductive to fire proliferation, due to climate change creating hotter and drier conditions. However, the complexity and extent of forest fires go further beyond the statistics, including human casualties, financial costs, and burnt land [1].  It is recognized as a \"major threat to public health security in the 21st century [2].\" From our forest fires data set, we want to **predict how much area will be burned in a forest fire by analyzing weather conditions known to affect fire occurrences**. \n",

    "The data consists of a collection of 517 records, each corresponding to a fire that occurred in the Montesinho natural park, in the northeast region of Portugal, from January 2000 to December 2003. The following list below contains the selected dataset predictors against our response variable, \"area\", which is measured in hectares.\n",

    "- DC (DC index from the FWI system) -> moisture content of deep organic layers (important to surface fire intensity and difficulty of control)\n",

    "In this analysis, we are drawing from a data set that is trustworthy. For one, there are no missing values. This means we don’t have to omit any observations, or fill in blanks ourselves, which makes our report more reliable. Additionally, the nature of the data is objective. By taking measurements of location, weather aspects, and area burnt, there is very little human subjectivity involved. Finally, by setting the seed to maintain consistent results and explaining our decision-making along the way, we will produce a reproducible and trustworthy report from the data."

    "Our report could be useful in many ways. For one, our results could help with resource designation, as there are only a finite amount of resources for fire-fighting. Therefore, if we know, for example, that low humidity is a big indicator of forest fire area, we can allocate more fire-fighting resources to areas with low-humidity than to high-humidity areas. In addition, our results could help with fire-preparation. If the data indicates that a fire is predicted to cover a very large area, it could be life saving to alert citizens of the danger to evacuate with ample warning."
